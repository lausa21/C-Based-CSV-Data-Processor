# C-Based-CSV-Data-Processor
This project is a command-line utility built in the C language to perform common data manipulation tasks on a `.csv` file. The program is designed to read a dataset from a CSV file into memory, and then provide a user-friendly, menu-driven interface to display, search, sort, and export the data.
